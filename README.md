Game where 2 players can get weapons on the board and then fight until dying.

### Movements and weapons
Every player has 100 life points. They start with a knife and can upgrade their damage power by taking new weapons on the board. They can only move in one of the 3 cells up, dow, left and right, unless there's an obstacle (black cell ro other player).

### Fight
Players fight when they are in 2 adjacent cells. Each player chooses to attack or defend. When attacking, the other player loses as many life points as the attacker weapon's damage. When defending, the player anticipates and will suffer only half of the attacker's damage on the next attack.

### End of the game
The game ends when one of the player has 0 life points left.
